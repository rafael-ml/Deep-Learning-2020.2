# Paint Transformer: Feed Forward Neural Painting with Stroke Prediction

> [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03798)] [[Paddle Implementation](https://github.com/wzmsltw/PaintTransformer)]

## Update

We have optimized the *serial* inference procedure to achieve better rendering quality and faster speed.

## Overview

This repository contains the official PaddlePaddle implementation of paper:

## Prerequisites

* Linux or macOS
* Python 3.6+
* PaddlePaddle 2.0+ and other dependencies (numpy, cv2, and other common python libs)

  ```shell
  python -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu
  ```

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/wzmsltw/PaintTransformer
  cd PaintTransformer
  ```

* Download pretrained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G0O81qSvGp0kFCgyaQHmPygbVHFi1--q/view?usp=sharing) and move it to inference directory:

  ```shell
  mv [Download Directory]/paint_best.pdparams inference/
  cd inference
  ```

* Inference: 

  ```shell
  python inference.py
  ```

  * Input image path, output path, and etc can be set in the main function.
  * Notably, there is a flag *serial* as one parameter of the main function:
    * If *serial* is True, strokes would be rendered serially. The consumption of video memory will be low but it requires more time. **Serial inference can achieve better rendering quality.**
    * If *serial* is False, strokes would be rendered in parallel. The consumption of video memory will be high but it would be faster.
    * If animated results are required, *serial* must be True.

* Train:

  * You can send email to us for the training codes.
